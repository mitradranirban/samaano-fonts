# The configuration for the builder is in YAML format. You can use
# https://www.yamllint.com/ to make sure that your configuration
# file is correctly formatted.

# First we need to define the source files to build. Please list
# all sources in the same family. These are expected to be in the
# sources/ directory, so all paths should be relative to that
# directory.
sources:
  - Samaano.designspace
  - Samaano-Bold.ufo
  - Samaano-Thin.ufo
  - Samaano-Wide-Bold.ufo
  - Samaano-Wide-Thin.ufo
  - Samaano-Bold-Slanted.ufo
  - Samaano-Thin-Slanted.ufo
  - Samaano-Wide-Bold-Slanted.ufo
  - Samaano-Wide-Thin-Slanted.ufo  

# You don't have to supply the family name, but builds are slightly
# faster if you do.
familyName: "Samaano"

# Next you can supply alternative paths for where you want the
# binaries to live. But we'd recommend you stick to the defaults
# especially if you are planning to upload your font to Google Fonts.
