Samaano is an attempt to learn creation of variable font using Open Source Tools like Fontforge, Fontra and some python script.
 

The Name Samaano comes fron the Hindi word Samaan , meaning equal indicating the spaces are equal in this font.
Indic fonts are usually not made monospaced, but the designer will use his experience with developing MitraMono, the first monospaced Bengali font made way back in 2002.
